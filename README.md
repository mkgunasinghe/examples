### Introduction  
This is where I maintain working examples of R and Python w/ brief descriptions.

Current Examples:  
1. Map exploration using GADM on R    
2. Article parsing and processing on Python  

Map exploration using GADM on R:  
>i. Extract country and province level spatial data on R with the example of Ecuador.   
ii. function to reduce the virtual memory associated with polygons by GADM is employed.  
iii. Color specific regions/cities and stack variable names on map.  
  
  *Article parsing and processing on Python:    
>Use newspaper, nltk, xlwt packages to;    
Download and parse articles from Bloomberg, CNN, and the Economist.    
Extract 'title', 'link', and 'keywords' associated with articles.  
Write data on an Excel workbook.
