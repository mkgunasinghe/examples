### Introduction  
This is where I maintain working examples of R and Python codes w/ brief descriptions.

**Current Examples:**  
1. Map exploration using GADM on R    
2. Article parsing and processing on Python  
3. Phoenix

Map exploration using GADM on R:       
>i. Extract country and province level spatial data on R with the example of Ecuador.   
ii. Function to reduce the virtual memory associated with polygons by GADM is employed.  
iii. Color specific regions/cities and stack variable names on map.  
  
Article parsing and processing on Python:       
>i. Use newspaper, nltk, xlwt packages to;    
ii. Download and parse articles from Bloomberg, CNN, and the Economist.    
iii. Extract 'title', 'link', and 'keywords' associated with articles.  
iv. Write data on an Excel workbook.

Access and visualise Phoenix data on R:  
>i. Code to access Phoenix data (http://phoenixdata.org/description):  
	contains near real-time event dataset from scraping over 400 news source and producing  
    ~ 3,000 events per day.  
ii. Able to fetch yesterday's data or construct a range and then view it on an  
	interactive map depending on specifications such as: country/ies, event type, etc.

Recorded observations (clustered) for Turkey in the 2 day range 10/03/16 - 11/03/16.
