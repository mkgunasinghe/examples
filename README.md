### Introduction  
This is where I maintain working examples of R and Python w/ brief descriptions.  
Current Examples:
+ Map exploration using GADM on R
+ Article parsing and processing on Python

Map exploration using GADM on R:  
>Extract country and province level spatial data on R with the example of Ecuador.   
A function to reduce the virtual memory associated with polygons by GADM is employed.  
Color specific regions/cities and stack variable names on map.  
  
Article parsing and processing on Python:    
>Use newspaper, nltk, xlwt packages to;    
Download and parse articles from Bloomberg, CNN, and the Economist.    
Extract 'title', 'link', and 'keywords' associated with articles.  
Write data on an Excel workbook.
